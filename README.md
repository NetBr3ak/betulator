## ü§î Why the Martingale Strategy?

The **Martingale strategy** is enticing due to its simplicity and its promise:
1. **Guaranteed recovery**: After every win, all previous losses are erased, and you achieve a profit equal to the initial bet \( b \).
2. **Ease of execution**: Double your bet after each loss, reset to the initial bet after each win.

However, beneath this simplicity lies the harsh reality of exponential growth, finite bankrolls, and the casino's edge. Let's delve into the mathematics and practical implications of Martingale.

---

## üß† How Does the Martingale Strategy Work?

### Key Rules
1. **Double your bet** after every loss.
2. **Reset to the initial bet** \( b \) after every win.

### Core Equations

#### Next Bet After \( L \) Losses
The bet size after \( L \) losses:
$$
b_{\text{next}} = b \cdot 2^L
$$

#### Total Amount Wagered After \( L \) Losses
The cumulative amount wagered:
$$
W_{\text{total}} = b \cdot (2^L - 1)
$$

#### Profit After a Win
Guaranteed profit after a win:
$$
\text{Profit} = b
$$

### Example: Bet Progression
If the initial bet is \( b = 10 \) and you lose 3 times in a row:
- First bet: \( b = 10 \)
- Second bet: \( b = 10 \cdot 2 = 20 \)
- Third bet: \( b = 20 \cdot 2 = 40 \)
- Fourth bet: \( b = 40 \cdot 2 = 80 \)

The total amount wagered:
$$
W_{\text{total}} = 10 + 20 + 40 + 80 = 150
$$

The profit if you win the fourth bet:
$$
\text{Profit} = 10
$$

---

## üìä Probability and Risks

### Roulette Probabilities
In European roulette:
- **Winning Probability**:
$$
P(\text{win}) = \frac{18}{37} \approx 48.65\%
$$

- **Losing Probability**:
$$
P(\text{lose}) = \frac{19}{37} \approx 51.35\%
$$

### Losing Streak Probability
The probability of losing \( L \) consecutive bets:
$$
P(\text{loss streak}) = \left( \frac{19}{37} \right)^L
$$

#### Example Calculations:
- Probability of losing 3 times in a row:
  $$
  P(\text{loss streak, 3}) = \left( \frac{19}{37} \right)^3 \approx 13.96\%
  $$

- Probability of losing 5 times in a row:
  $$
  P(\text{loss streak, 5}) = \left( \frac{19}{37} \right)^5 \approx 2.18\%
  $$

- Probability of losing 10 times in a row:
  $$
  P(\text{loss streak, 10}) = \left( \frac{19}{37} \right)^{10} \approx 0.048\%
  $$

---

## üßÆ Financial Implications

### Exponential Growth of Bets
The size of bets grows exponentially after consecutive losses:
$$
b_{\text{next}} = b \cdot 2^L
$$

#### Example:
- Initial bet: \( b = 10 \)
- After 5 losses:
  $$
  b_{\text{next}} = 10 \cdot 2^5 = 320
  $$
- After 10 losses:
  $$
  b_{\text{next}} = 10 \cdot 2^{10} = 10,240
  $$

### Total Amount Wagered
The total amount wagered after \( L \) losses:
$$
W_{\text{total}} = b \cdot (2^L - 1)
$$

#### Example:
- \( b = 10 \), \( L = 10 \):
  $$
  W_{\text{total}} = 10 \cdot (2^{10} - 1) = 10,230
  $$

---

## üè¶ Casino Constraints

### Table Limits
Most casinos impose limits to prevent Martingale abuse. For example:
- **Minimum Bet**: \( b_{\text{min}} = 10 \)
- **Maximum Bet**: \( b_{\text{max}} = 500 \)

The maximum streak you can sustain before hitting the limit:
$$
L_{\text{max}} = \log_2\left(\frac{b_{\text{max}}}{b_{\text{min}}}\right)
$$

#### Example:
- \( b_{\text{min}} = 10 \), \( b_{\text{max}} = 500 \):
  $$
  L_{\text{max}} = \log_2\left(\frac{500}{10}\right) = 5.64
  $$
Thus, you can only double up 5 times before exceeding the table limit.

## üî¢ Advanced Concepts

### Risk of Ruin
The **Risk of Ruin** measures the probability of losing your entire bankroll before achieving a win:
$$
\text{Risk of Ruin} = (1 - e)^{\frac{B}{b}}
$$
Where:
- \( B \) is the bankroll,
- \( b \) is the initial bet,
- \( e \) is the house edge (\( e = 0.027 \) for European roulette).

#### Example:
- \( B = 1,000 \), \( b = 10 \):
  $$
  \text{Risk of Ruin} = (1 - 0.027)^{\frac{1000}{10}} \approx 5.04\%
  $$

### Expected Value (EV)
The **Expected Value** combines probabilities and outcomes:
$$
EV = P(\text{win}) \cdot \text{Profit} - P(\text{lose}) \cdot \text{Loss}
$$

#### Example:
- \( b = 10 \),
- \( P(\text{win}) = 48.65\% \),
- \( P(\text{lose}) = 51.35\% \),
- Total loss after 5 streaks \( W_{\text{total}} = 310 \):
  $$
  EV = (0.4865 \cdot 10) - (0.5135 \cdot 310) \approx -5.31
  $$

The negative \( EV \) confirms that the house edge ensures a long-term loss.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Conclusion

The **Martingale strategy** is alluring in its simplicity but flawed in execution. The exponential growth of bets, combined with finite bankrolls and casino-imposed limits, ensures its unsustainability.

Despite its short-term appeal, Martingale remains a cautionary tale of how mathematics governs chance. üé≤
